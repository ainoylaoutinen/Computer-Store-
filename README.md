This is my solution for the assignment 1 "Komputer Store", written in basic JavaScript. It has four parts: a bank account, a work account, a laptop selection area and an information area about the chosen laptop. Then, to combine the parts, you are able to buy the chosen laptop if the funds in your bank account are enough.

The functionality is the same as in the example- no parts should be missing on that side. On the design side of things, there might be minor differences since I like to be creative.
